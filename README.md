# Flow-Analysis
The code directory consists of scripts written in MATLAB.
Codes are categorized according to experimental data types:

  =>  Acoustic Analysis: Contains scripts for processing pressure data from far field & near field        experiments and extracting temporal frequency distribution of supersonic jet noise.
  
  =>  Global Functions: Contains common function scripts that are accesed by all the codes. This          includes scripts that specify data location directory & critical geometric parameters for          scaling & length scale normalization.
  
  =>  PIV Analysis: Script files that deal with organizing, filetering, processing & data                  extraction from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) vector data.
  
  =>  POD Analysis: Script files that deal with implementation of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition          (POD) technique of spatial energy decomposition on PIV as well as Schlieren images
  
  =>  Schlieren Image Analysis: Script files that deal with processing high-speed Schlieren images        which includes spatial & temporal decomposition of images to extract frequency specific            energy distribution in supersonic flows.
